# Rover personality

We know that a startup requires not only the right skill-set, but also the right personality.<br>
Which is why we all like to have fun. All work and no play is just not OK!<br>

# The Team

<img src="/img/robert_new_author_pic.jpg" width="100px" alt="Robert James"> <br>
<strong> Robert James </strong> is the energetic founder and CEO of Rover. <br>
A fourth-year marketing student at UAB and avid consumer, he has a keen eye for seeing things that could be better. <br>
"My vision for Rover came from an experience while studying abroad in London in Fall 2015. <br>
I realized three things about retail that are fundamentally poor: it's really hard to find what you want, it's super expensive, and it takes so much longer than it should.<br>
So I thought, "why not make it better?""<br>
He spends <i>way</i> too much time learning front-end development.
