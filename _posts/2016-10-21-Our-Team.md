# Rover personality

We know that a startup requires not only the right skill-set, but also the right personality.<br>
Which is why we all like to have fun. All work and no play is just not OK!<br>

# The Team

<strong> Robert James </strong> is the energetic founder and CEO of Rover. <br><br>
A fourth-year marketing student at UAB and avid consumer, he has a keen eye for seeing things that could be better. <br>
<blockquote>
<p>"My vision for Rover came from an experience while studying abroad in London in Fall 2015. <br>
I realized three issues with retail that should not exist:<br>
1. Ridiculous difficulty in finding products;<br>
2. Prohibitively expensive to the majority of people (especially college students); and <br>
3. Amount of time spent is at least two times longer than it should take. <br><br>
So I thought, "why not make it better?" I have <strike> no idea </strike> a solid idea and solution to these problems, and I am so excited for you to use it! It will change how you shop. "</p><br>

He spends <i>way</i> too much time learning front-end development.
